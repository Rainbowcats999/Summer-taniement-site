        <main> <ol> All my experiences rated out of 5 and why:
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>Rides - 3/5: There were no lines for some of them, but for others it was like a 40 minute wait.
            I also HATED the fact that if you don't have anyone to hold your stuff, they don't hold it for you 
          and force you to rent a locker. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Food - 2/5: Their food looks very delicious, but what the hell are these prices?! Tried to 
            charge me $11 for a dippin dots medium ice cream. Also I read the reviews that clearly stated that
            the quality is complete garbage and they're just completely ripping us off.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Interaction with the employees - 1/5: Probably the worst experience of them all, that staff, was so
            rude to me. They're always giving me attitude " don't do this don't do that this is not allowed that is not
            allowed." Communication with their staff takes up more of my energy and strength than taking an AP test.
          </li>
      <br>
          <li>Paying for stuff - 1/5: If I could give zero I would, what the hell is this payment policy they have.
            Don't accept cash anywhere, not on the rides, not in the resturants, not in the arcade not anywhere. You have 
            to pay with your credit card. I don't even have one yet, I'm a minor, they don't give them out to people our age.
            Using cash just makes your life so much easier, it sucks that they don't accept it anywhere that's just stupid. <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128181;</span><span style='font-size:30px;'>&#2612;</span>

            <h3>Overall experience: I apologize for my constant complaing and ranting but 
              this is just how I feel about all this.
              It wasn't as good as I anticipated it to be, six flags, I really had higher expectations.
              It's safe to say that I won't be coming back to this place for a while... if ever again.
